What does VPSM stand for?
It is short for VPS Manager. I got the idea for the name from Cisco's UCS Manager (UCSM).

What exactly is VPSM?
VPSM is an open source VPS management solution, think of it as a SolusVM or HyperVM alternative.

What makes VPSM different than the rest?
VPSM is completely Free Open Source Software (FOSS). You don't pay for anything. Just download, install, and use it.

What license is VPSM under?
It is licensed under the MIT License (http://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license).

What does FOSS mean to me?
No one-time fees. No monthly invoices. No encoded files. Just pure code that you can alter to your hearts content and not having to pay a dime for it.

Can VPSM be trusted?
Check the code yourself if you don't trust it. :)

What about external security audits?
We plan on getting an external security audit of the code done once a stable release is available.

What is the GUI going to look like?
Right now we do not have anybody to work on the interface so it will be a very basic interface.

Will there be a SolusVM import script?
Yes. That is one the requirements we included in the project.

Will there be WHMCS integration?
Yes, the software is being built around WHMCS so it's actually an addon for WHMCS but that level of flexibility allows it to easily drop into other billing systems.

Do I need to be a VPS company to use this script?
No. It is being designed to work nicely for personal or business use.

What support is/will be offered?
Community support will be the primary focus. Once the project is complete, paid support options may be available.

What virtualization will VPSM support?
As of right now we know it is being designed for OpenVZ but we hope to include Xen and KVM once the OpenVZ portion is complete.
